XBMCPicons
==========

A simple script for getting XBMC frontend friendly picons form a channel.conf

Huge thanks goes to: [picons](https://github.com/ocram/picons) and [piconlinks.py](https://github.com/tkurbad/piconscripts#piconscripts)

* Take a look into the  ```piconsXbmc.sh ``` what it does. Generally it should be enough for you to call  ```sh ./piconsXbmc.sh``` and afterwards in the folder: ```xbmc_icons``` all your icons should be there.
* This git repo depends on the picons repo, so you need to call  ```git submodule init ``` and  ```git submodule update``` to get the latest picons
* To just find out what parameter the  ```xbmcIconLinks.py``` script takes call ```python2 xbmcIconLinks.py -h```
